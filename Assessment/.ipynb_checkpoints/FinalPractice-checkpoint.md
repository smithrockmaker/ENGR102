### ENGR 102: Final Exam Practice

This exercise is intended to provide an opportunity for you to articulate many of the skills from this course in a single activity. We will explore how this particular object from printables (contributed by [this gentleman](https://www.printables.com/@PabloUntroib_974957)) can be evaluated from an engineering design perspective, considered from the perspective of 3D printed manufacturing, and finally provide a vehicle for describing how you would approach the design of the components in Fusion 360.

### The Object: A handle for jigsaw blades

For those who have not used a jigsaw is it commonly a reciprocating power tool these days. The power tool pushes the blade forward and back in the vertical plane. It cuts, as you can see from the teeth, on the upstroke. The blades for this tool are easily available and there some applications where using it by hand would be more effective that using the power tool. This object addresses this need.

**Deliverable(s): 1** 

What details do you notice about the design of this tool? How many distinct parts appear to be involved? Can you decide which way the nut moves to hold the blade in place? Can you articulate a reason why one side is flat?

### The Nut:

**Deliverable(s): 2** 

Assuming you are printing this object with a 3D filament printer is there a better orientation on the build plate - why or why not? Are there features which will probably need supports in this orientation? Would you print this part with thick layers (0.30 mm or greater) or with thin layers (0.15 or 0.20 mm)? Explain your reasoning.

**Deliverable(s): 3**
