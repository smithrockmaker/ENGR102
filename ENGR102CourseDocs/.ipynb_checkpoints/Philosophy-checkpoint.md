## Education/Teaching Philosophy

This story is taken from a text called ["The Way of Chuang Tzu"](https://sofoarchon.com/inspirational-taoist-quotes-and-stories-by-chuang-tzu/) as translated by the philosopher-monk [Thomas Merton](https://merton.org/chrono.aspx).

> Duke Hwan of Khi, first in his dynasty,  
  Sat under his canopy reading his philosophy.  
  And Phien the wheelwright was out in the yard.  
  making a wheel.
>               
> Phien laid aside hammer and chisel,  
  climbed the steps,  
  and said to Duke Hwan,  
  "May I ask you, Lord,  
  What is this you are reading?"  
> 
> The Duke said: "The Experts. The Authorities."  
  and Phien asked: "Alive or dead?"  
  The Duke said: "Dead a long time."  
  "Then," said the wheelwright,  
  "You are reading only the dirt they left behind."
>
>Then the Duke replied: "What do you know about it?   
  You are only a wheelwright.  
  You had better give me a good explanation  
  or else you must die."
> 
> The Wheelwright said,  
  "Let us look at the affair from my point of view.  
  When I make wheels, if I go easy, they fall apart,
  if I am too rough, they do not fit.  
  If I am neither too easy nor too violent  
  they come out right,  
> and the work is what I want it to be.
>
> You cannot put this into words,  
  you just have to know how it is.  
  I cannot even tell my own son exactly how it is done,  
  and my own son cannot learn it from me.  
  So here I am, seventy years old, still making wheels!
> 
> The men of old took all they really knew  
  with them to the grave.  
  And so, Lord, what you are reading there  
  is only the dirt they left behind them."

Now that I am nearly 70 myself this story is getting more immediate. It makes an essential point about learning which is that learning at it's root is fundamentally personal. We must each develop our own understanding of what we are seeking to understand whether that is a craft or something more abstract like math. As a teacher I can help by creating activities that create opportunities for you to build your personal understanding. I can redirect your attention if it seems like there is something that is escaping your notice. You can assist your learning by noticing what does or doesn't make sense and asking questions or trying different approaches. The central thing I can not do is learn for you.
