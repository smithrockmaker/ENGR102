## Office Hours: Contact

As a part time instructor I am not on campus except on the days when we have class. This complicates making contact in some ways but can also be a source of flexibility.

#### Connecting:

**Phone:** The college phone will ring in the mosh pit and I won't be there. Please use email to reach out:)
 
**Email:** bemerson@cocc.edu - I check this email regularly if not all the time. This will be the best way to connect in general.

**Office:** MSC 278 - the part time mosh pit. ///uniformity.reduced.indecision (**what3words address**)

You don't know about [what3words](https://what3words.com/ringed.wriggling.joining) yet? Time to learn a new thing for geolocation. There is an app as well no surprise:)

 

Here is my basic availability for Office Hours:

#### M/W:

I will generally arrive at the Science building between 1:30 and 2:00 on days when we have class. Between then and 3:00 I'll be pretty available.  I may or may not be sitting in my office (**MSC 278**) which is the part time mosh pit in the middle of the hallway. If I'm not in there check in the physics labs (MSC 240/250) or look in the 'skyboxes'. In the past students have said it is sometimes effective to listen for my voice which is apparently deep and obnoxious.

**Students in Calc:** I will stay after class on Monday's to give you all an opportunity to get input and ask questions. 

I will also typically be able to stay after class for a bit if you have questions then.

#### Zoom:

Once the college gets me back in the system I will have a personal zoom meeting room which I will list here. I'm happy to work with you to set up a time for both of us to connect over zoom.
