## Office Hours: Contact

As a part time instructor I am not on campus except on the days when we have class. This complicates making contact in some ways but can also be a source of flexibility.

#### Connecting:

**Phone:** The college phone will ring in the mosh pit and I won't be there. Please use email to reach out:)
 
**Email:** bemerson@cocc.edu - I check this email regularly if not all the time. This will be the best way to connect in general.

**Office:** MSC 278 - the part time mosh pit. ///uniformity.reduced.indecision (**what3words address**)

You don't know about [what3words](https://what3words.com/ringed.wriggling.joining) yet? Time to learn a new thing for geolocation. There is an app as well no surprise:)

 

Here is my basic availability for Office Hours:

#### M/W:

I will generally arrive at the Science building between 1:30 and 2:00 on days when we have class. Between then and 3:00 I'll be pretty available.  I may or may not be sitting in my office (**MSC 278**) which is the part time mosh pit in the middle of the hallway. If I'm not in there check in the physics labs (MSC 240/250) or look in the 'skyboxes'. In the past students have said it is sometimes effective to listen for my voice which is apparently deep and obnoxious.

**Students in Calc:** I will stay after class on Monday's to give you all an opportunity to get input and ask questions. On Wednesday we should have some time during lab at some point for more questions. Thanks for letting me know about the schedule conflict. 

#### Zoom:

Zoom suggests that my personal meeting room for this term is [https://cocc.zoom.us/j/8319469871](https://cocc.zoom.us/j/8319469871). We can certainly set up a meeting via email if other options for connecting don't work for you:)
