## Education/Teaching Philosophy

This story is taken from a text called ["The Way of Chuang Tzu"](https://sofoarchon.com/inspirational-taoist-quotes-and-stories-by-chuang-tzu/) as translated by the philosopher-monk [Thomas Merton](https://merton.org/chrono.aspx).

> Duke Hwan of Khi, first in his dynasty,  
  Sat under his canopy reading his philosophy.  
  And Phien the wheelwright was out in the yard.  
  making a wheel.
>               
> Phien laid aside hammer and chisel,  
  climbed the steps,  
  and said to Duke Hwan,  
  "May I ask you, Lord,  
  What is this you are reading?"  
> 
> The Duke said: "The Experts. The Authorities."  
  and Phien asked: "Alive or dead?"  
  The Duke said: "Dead a long time."  
  "Then," said the wheelwright,  
  "You are reading only the dirt they left behind."
>
>Then the Duke replied: "What do you know about it?   
  You are only a wheelwright.  
  You had better give me a good explanation  
  or else you must die."
> 
> The Wheelwright said,  
  "Let us look at the affair from my point of view.  
  When I make wheels, if I go easy, they fall apart,
  if I am too rough, they do not fit.  
  If I am neither too easy nor too violent  
  they come out right,  
> and the work is what I want it to be.
>
> You cannot put this into words,  
  you just have to know how it is.  
  I cannot even tell my own son exactly how it is done,  
  and my own son cannot learn it from me.  
  So here I am, seventy years old, still making wheels!
> 
> The men of old took all they really knew  
  with them to the grave.  
  And so, Lord, what you are reading there  
  is only the dirt they left behind them."

Now that I am nearly 70 myself this story is getting more immediate. It makes an essential point about learning which is that learning, at it's root, is fundamentally personal. We must each develop our own understanding of what we are seeking to understand whether that is a craft or something more abstract like math. As a teacher I can help by designing activities that create opportunities for you to build your personal understanding. I can redirect your attention if it seems like there is something that is escaping your notice. You can assist in your own learning by noticing what does or doesn't make sense and asking questions or trying different approaches. The central thing I can not do is learn for you. 

## Creative Commons/OER/Open Access

As you are no doubt aware there are many different ways that people think about sharing their ideas, insights, skills, or experiences. At my core I am a open source/resource person who thinks it's generally more effective to share stuff rather than hold onto it. Expecially in the context of public education where you have paid my salary that leads to the course content. If you want to explore this a little here is a good article from [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/06/what-is-open-access-free-sharing-of-all-human-knowledge/).

Because the basic access point for COCC courses is the Canvas course I will endeavor to keep those pages generally up to date. 

In the days when texts were more common most of would save our texts from important classes as a future reference. When I applied to graduate school I used my freshman physics text as a study tool for practicing for the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) which is often used for admission decisions. With the vast resources of the web it is totally reasonable to go to the internet in search of guidance when you have questions. Both static and video resources are generally available though sometimes the relevance or trustworthyness is a little questionable. I would like to be sure that you can get back to the material for this class if you ever feel a need. That could be for your own uses or to help a friend or family member learn about something we do. In any case the core materials for this course will be available on [my github](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/tree/main) for this course. The files will render and be readable on the github. If you want a copy of the material in your own possesion you can download the file)s but you will need to use a tool like Jupyterlab to render those files into pdf's or other printable forms. Fortunately you will learn how to do that in ENGR103!!

Lastly, this.....Creative Commons licensing is something you should all be aware of.
