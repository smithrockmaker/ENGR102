## Project 2: Guidelines

**Caveat:**

Please note that the projects this term are newly designed and therefore may have some issues. Please give your instructor feedback at any point about anything which is confusing or seems like it could be improved. Modifications to the guidelines do require instructor approval which will NOT be unreasonably withheld. Communicate!!

## Due Date: Due Wednesday March 19, 2025 (5:00 pm)

### Project Goals/Outcomes:

At the end of this project you will have demonstrated the following skills:

**Engineering Design:**

<blockquote>
    
* Create an object which is composed of at least two components that are connected by either a compliant or interlocking mechanism.

* Articulate clearly the value of this object to the end user. 

* Create a strategy for assessing the effectiveness of your design solution.
    
</blockquote>

**Fusion Skills:**

<blockquote>
    
* Build a Fusion model from scratch to produce an object meeting design criteria.

* Use techniques of parametric modeling in the design to facilitate updating of the model.

* Export relevant files that are needed by the fabrication process.

* Assess and adapt model as needed to improve intended functionality.
    
</blockquote>

**Fabrication (3D Printing) Skills:**

<blockquote>
    
* Demonstrate an awareness of material characteristics and process limitations in your designed solution.

* Demonstrate mastery of each significant process in 3D printing listed in the guidelines.

* Complete and assess the printed object relative to the assessment strategy you articulated in the design portion of these outcomes.
  
</blockquote>

## Project Guidelines:

### 1: Project Choice:

Again, you may start from any of the many printable objects found on Thingiverse, Printables, NASA, and Grabcad. These sites offer free access to printable objects. There are many sites for commercial/industrial sharing of files but for this project I insist that you work from a free resource.

The object that you choose for inspiration should have the following characteristics:

<blockquote>

* Solves a meaningful need for you. Entertainment and cuteness will NOT be considered a meaningful need in the context of this project.

* You will build a Fusion model of the object from scratch. Consider how you will accomplish this as you choose your project.

* The object will include as least two components that either interlock or are connected via a compliant mechanism.

</blockquote>

### 2: Implement and Track Design Stages:

Your design documentation should take the form of a 1-2 page document (.docx format preferred). Best practice is to start this document as you begin the project and update it every couple of days as you progress through the project. This process makes it relatively easy to meet the documentation expectations. 

Your documentation of your design stages should have the following characteristics:

<blockquote>

* Create a text document (.docx or equivalent) that contains your discussion of each of the design steps and its role in your design solution. 

* At the head of your text document provide links and attribution to the designs and designers that influenced your solution.

* It is likely that you will find yourself printing several versions of your solution as you adjust it to meet your defined needs. Be careful to document those tests and what you learned from each of them.

* Document, for the final version of your design, print times, print settings, filament usage, and rough cost of materials. You will need to visit the Prusa store to find the cost of filament in our spools.

</blockquote>

### 3: Create Fusion Model:

Starting from the design you have identified create a Fusion model of the same object. 

The Fusion model you create should have the following characteristics:

<blockquote>

* Your model design is structured to allow easy customization of the model in response to testing/prototyping that you will do in the fabrication stage of this project.

* As previously stated your model must consist of at least two components that are connected via a compliant or interlocking mechanism.

* For this project you will submit your Fusion file as part of your project.

</blockquote>

### 4: Documentation Expectations:

As we have dicussed in class documentation is acknowledged to be critical in all science and engineering settings and yet we tend to gloss over the actual execution of documentation. Because we will be doing a second project later in the term think of this project as an opportunity to build the structure for documentation of any technical project. Create blank documents that you can use again later and organize headings etc to facilitate reuse in the future.

The documentation for this project will have the following characteristics:

<blockquote>

* A title page with your name, class information, and a name for your design.

* Your design documentation from part 2 above.

* Export your Fusion file to create a local copy, zip it up (compress), and submit along with your other documentation.

* A reflection/assessment of the success or failure of your printed object (part 5). This reflection/assessment should consider technical and material analysis as well as discussion of it's ability to provide the intended value to the user.

</blockquote>

### 5: 3D Print of Current Best Design Solution

Your 3D prints of the 'final' design solution (alternatively your current best design solution) will be delivered to your instructor. Be aware that your design solution may be shared with the class for everyone's benefit.
