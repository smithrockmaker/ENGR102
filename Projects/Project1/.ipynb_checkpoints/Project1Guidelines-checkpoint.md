## Project 1: Guidelines

**Caveat:**

Please note that the projects this term are newly designed and therefore may have some issues. Please give your instructor feedback at any point about anything which is confusing or seems like it could be improved. Modifications to the guidelines do require instructor approval which will NOT be unreasonably withheld. Communicate!!

## Due Date: Due Friday February 21, 2025 (5:00 pm)

### Project Goals/Outcomes:

At the end of this project you will have demonstrated the following skills:

**Engineering Design:**

<blockquote>
    
* Identify and articulate a 'problem to be solved' and someone else's solution that addresses the problem.

* Communicate effectively as you work through each step of a design process. 

* Create a strategy for assessing the effectiveness of your design solution.
    
</blockquote>

**Fusion Skills:**

<blockquote>
    
* Build a Fusion model based on an external reference.

* Create a thoughtful design timeline that facilitates modifying the model 'easily'

* Export relevant files that are needed by the fabrication process.

* Demonstrate and document iterative improvements in your model.
    
</blockquote>

**Fabrication (3D Printing) Skills:**

<blockquote>
    
* Demonstrate an awareness of material characteristics and process limitations in your designed solution.

* Demonstrate mastery of each significant process in 3D printing listed in the guidelines.

* Complete and assess the printed object relative to the assessment strategy you articulated in the design portion of these outcomes.
  
</blockquote>

## Project Guidelines:

### 1: Project Choice:

Starting from the many printable objects found on Thingiverse, Printables, NASA, and Grabcad. These sites offer free access to printable objects. There are many sites for commercial/industrial sharing of files but for this project I insist that you work from a free resource.

The object that you choose to work with should have the following characteristics:

<blockquote>

* Solves a meaningful need for you. Entertainment and cuteness will NOT be considered a meaningful need in the context of this project.

* An .stl file and/or a step (.stp) file are available for the object. Fusion files or other CAD files can NOT be used by you in the context of this project.

* You will be required to alter the design you have chosen in some important way to meet your personal needs.

</blockquote>

### 2: Implement and Track Design Stages:

As you progress through this project articulate how the idea and design you have chosen responds to each of the steps in the dschool (or D-Lab) design process we discussed in class. Some steps will necessarily be a little abbreviated (not likely to be a lot of ideation possibilities) but each stage should be addressed.

Your documentation of your design stages should have the following characteristics:

<blockquote>

* Create a text document (.docx or equivalent) that contains your discussion of each of the design steps and its role in your design solution. 

* At the head of your text document provide links and attribution to the designs and designers that influenced your solution.

* It is likely that you will find yourself printing several versions of your solution as you adjust it to meet your defined needs. Be careful to document those tests and what you learned from each of them.

* Document, for the final version of your design, print times, print settings, filament usage, and rough cost of materials. You will need to visit the Prusa store to find the cost of filament in our spools.

</blockquote>

### 3: Create Fusion Model:

Starting from the design you have identified create a Fusion model of the same object. 

The Fusion model you create should have the following characteristics:

<blockquote>

* Your model design is structured to allow easy customization of the model in response to testing/prototyping that you will do in the fabrication stage of this project.

* Your design must include significant changes to the design that provided the inspiration for your project. You will need your instructors signature approving your design changes.

* For each version of your model that you print you will need to create and retain a fully specified shop drawing. These shop drawings will form a history of your design process.

</blockquote>

### 4: Documentation Expectations:

As we have dicussed in class documentation is acknowledged to be critical in all science and engineering settings and yet we tend to gloss over the actual execution of documentation. Because we will be doing a second project later in the term think of this project as an opportunity to build the structure for documentation of any technical project. Create blank documents that you can use again later and organize headings etc to facilitate reuse in the future.

The documentation for this project will have the following characteristics:

<blockquote>

* A title page with your name, class information, and a name for your design.

* Your design documentation from part 2 above.

* Fully dimensioned shop drawings for all versions of your design solution (at least first and last - I'm unlikely to believe you if you say you got it perfect the first time!).

* You will probably need to assemble all of the parts of your documentation (some will be docs, others will be pdf's, and there may be images) and then scan them to a single pdf to submit to Canvas.

</blockquote>

### 5: 3D Print of Current Best Design Solution

Your 3D prints of the 'final' design solution (alternatively your current best design solution) will be delivered to your instructor. Be aware that your design solution will be shared with the class for everyone's benefit.
