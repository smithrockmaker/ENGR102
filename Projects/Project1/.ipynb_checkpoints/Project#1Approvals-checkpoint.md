## Project #1: Approvals

There are a variety of points in this project where you will need to get buy in from instructor. To verify that you have done so an approval sheet is provided. Keep this with your project materials as you complete the various tasks. Because this is the first iteration of this project be aware that the approval sheet might change along the way. One hopes not but it's possible.

**NOTE:** It is recommended that you take a picture of your approval sheet after each signature in the event you should lose your original approval sheet. Of course your instructor will believe you when you remind them that they already signed off on some step. Will your future supervisor?
