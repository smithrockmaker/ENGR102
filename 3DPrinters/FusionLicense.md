## Getting Fusion 360

### Last edit: 1/3/2025

Some stuff has changed at COCC just recently so there are some parts of this process that might be slightly different.


### [Fusion 360 Educational Landing Page:](https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview#)

I find it a bit of a pain to get to the landing page for educational licenses for Autodesk product. The link above should take you there directly. When you get there is should look something like this.....

### Select Student:

Select the student plan which should take you here....

Enter your COCC email address (won't work if you don't) and Autodesk should recognize the 'cocc.edu'. We now have an institutional account. 

Because I am already in the system I can't quite see what happens next so please report back to me. At the end of the process you should be prompted to download the Fusion client onto your computer (laptop or desktop). 

The first time to start up Fusion 360 it will probably ask for your account email. If it launches successfully it should look something like this...

Note the (Education License) in the header. 

Please let me know at bemerson@cocc.edu if your experience is confusing. Screen shots will be very helpful in updating this document to be most useful. Thanks.
