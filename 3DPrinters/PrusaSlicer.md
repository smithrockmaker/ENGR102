## Getting Prusa Slicer

### Last edit: 1/3/2025

Prusa makes their software freely available for all their machines. Be aware that what you are looking to download here are the Drivers and Apps for your computer. The drivers might be slightly different for different computers but the Slicer software is universal I think. 

### [Prusa Knowledge Base: Downloads](https://help.prusa3d.com/downloads)

Download the drivers and apps for your computer. Best practice here is to scroll down the page until you find the section for the MK3S+ . You want the Drivers and Apps 2.9.0 package (see below). There are 3 options really - Mac, Windows, and Linux. Once you have downloaded the installer package for your computer (for Mac's this will be a .dmg file, for Windows and Linux it is a .exe file) drag it to your desktop. Double clicking should open the installer and from there follow the directions.

**NOTE** This is not quite as simple as installing an app on your phone and may involve some choices about installation location. In the past some students have had issues getting software installed. The Helpdesk in the Pioneer Hall computer lab can help if that's an option. Google might also be helpful. Your instructor will certainly be glad to assist if you can bring your laptop to class.

Once Prusa Slicer is installed you might want to place a shortcut on your desktop or toolbar for the duration of this course.

### For future:

For practice you might want to find the particular model of 3D printer (MK3S+) so you see how we would get a firmware update for our machines. 

**NOTE** Firmware is the code (computer program) that actually runs the 3D printer. Prusa Slicer needs to know what firmware is operating  the printer when it generates the G-code for the firmware to interpret. 

You can also download the handbook for the MK3S+ (a pdf) if you want to have a personal copy for reference.
