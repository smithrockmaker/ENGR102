## 3D Printing: Week 3

**Topic:** 

Modification of printer settings in Prusa Slicer to expose infill patterns

**Outcomes:** 

* Review skills from previous weeks

* Adjust specific printer settings in Prusa Slicer to expose infill patterns

* Examine and assess infill patterns relative to engineering characteristics (reference document)

**Class/Lab Prep:** 

Demonstrate the relevant printer settings that need to be modified. Thoughtful organizing of setting profiles also emphasized. 

**Lab: 3D Print**  

Print exposed infill to experience the different choices. Import provided .stl file to Prusa Slicer, choose characteristics, and print. Observe and describe features of resulting print.
