## 3D Printing: Week 2

**Topic:** 

Introduction to the 3D printer. 

**Outcomes:** 

* Be able to identify important features of the 3D printer

* Execute basic operational tasks for printing

* Understand and implement the printing of a simple gcode file from an SD card.

**Class:** 

Identify resources for both the Prusa MK3S printers we will be using and 3D printers in general. Discuss relationship to other fabrication methods and introduce process flow for 3D printing.

**Lab:** 

Explore printer anatomy, basic operational tasks, and print a simple object (hopefully with no errors:).
