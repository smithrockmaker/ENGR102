## 3D Printing: Week 5

### Week 5:

**Topic:** 

Print an articulated object reviewing previously developed process skills. Explore reverse engineering skills.

**Outcomes:** 

* Use shop drawings to track fabrication details of original toy block and the 'updated' toy block.

* Set up and print both blocks and test fit with real 'lego bricks'.

* Reflect on the engineering characteristics of the two printed toy blocks.

**Class:** All in Lab

**Lab: 3D Print** 

Print two versions of the toy block and assess their engineering performance against a real 'lego brick'. [Lab 4: Guide](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/3DPrinters/LabGuides/3DLab5.md)
