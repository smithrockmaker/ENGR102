## 3D Printing: Week 4

### Week 4:

**Topic:** 

Print an articulated object reviewing previously developed process skills. Explore reverse engineering skills.

**Outcomes:** 

* Review skills from previous weeks

* Print an articulated object. There are a number of options.

* From the Slicer representation reverse engineer the articulating mechanism embedded in the print.

* Reflect on your personal reverse engineering skills

**Class:** All in Lab

**Lab: 3D Print** 

Print an articulated object created by someone else. Reverse engineer the articulation design from the slicer information. [Lab 4: Guide](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/3DPrinters/LabGuides/3DLab4.md)
