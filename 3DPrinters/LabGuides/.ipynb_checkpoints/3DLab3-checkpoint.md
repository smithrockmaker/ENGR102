## ENGR102 Lab #3

This document is intended to describe the details of activities that will take place during this lab. Deliverables are items that you will each turn in (as a document) or demonstrate (to your instructor) to recieve full credit for the lab.

Generally any worksheets that you need for lab will be provided at the lab. I have linked the documents for any other potential users.

For the lab you will be working with [InfillTest.stl](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/3DPrinters/stlFiles/Infill/InfillTest.stl) as your model file.

### Activity 1: Intro to Prusa Slicer

Using the resources presented in class to complete the [Prusa Slicer Intro](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/3DPrinters/LabGuides/worksheets/InfillTest.docx).

### Activity 2: Define Print Features: Layers and Perimeters

To be able to see the actual infill pattern we have to eliminate the top layers of the print. At the same time you will explore changing the number of perimeter layers as well. Refer to [Week3Content](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/Classroom/Week3Content.md) for reminders of how to access and modify the menus. 

### Activity 3: Choose Infill Patterns

Each group will be assigned 3 infill patterns to print. In Normal mode the are 18 possible patterns in Prusa Slicer. This will allow us to get a clear sense of what the patterns look and feel like.

### Activity 4: Print Test Objects

Depending on details this should take about 30-45 min if you have been efficient about getting your gcode organized and copied to the SD card. Along the way you are reviewing your printing skills. Each member of the group will take full preparation and printing responsibility for one of the tests.

### Activity 5: Reflection

Read Prusa's article about [infill patterns and their applications](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/infill-patterns_177130) Describe how your print experience validates or not the time and material assertions in the Prusa article. This assumes you have noted filament usage and well as print time for each of your prints. In addition discuss the three prints your group did with another group and see if your results are consistent with theirs.

If you wish to look a litte further here is another discussion of the engineering characteristics that result from infill choices. It doesn't explore all of the Prusa possibilities but will give you a sense of the richness of this topic.
