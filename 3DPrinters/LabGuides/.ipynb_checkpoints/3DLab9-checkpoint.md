## ENGR102 Lab #9

This document is intended to describe the details of activities that will take place during this lab. Deliverables are items that you will each turn in (as a document) or demonstrate (to your instructor) to recieve full credit for the lab.

Generally any worksheets that you need for lab will be provided at the lab. I have linked the documents for any other potential users.

For the lab you will be working with an .stl file from [articulated folder](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/3DPrinters/stlFiles/snapfit/) as your model file.

### Activity 1: Choose Snap Fit Model

Choose an .stl file from those in the compliant folder on the github (linked above). All of these models create objects with different common snap fit structures. This particular set of prints was created by [Kaje](https://www.printables.com/@kaje) from a report from an MIT class on making things in 2012. The important link is to whats called the [Bayer Manual for Snap Fit joints in plastic](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/documents/snapfitDesign/Plastic_Snap_fit_design-1.pdf). Kaje's purposes seem similar to ours and his models all print in less than 30 min (sometimes need .30 mm layers). 

### Activity 2: Print the Model

Nothing more to be said......

### Activity 3: Assess the Success of the Print

When your group completes it's print **be sure to clean up** all the plastic bits at the printer before moving on to explore how the snap fit object behaves. Is the connection positive or weak? What are the design parameters you could change to improve the positivity of the connection? Is it designed to come apart and be reused or is it a once and done connection?

### Activity 4: Reflection

In your reflection on this lab be sure to include your answers to the questions asked above in Activity 3. A snap fit connector is part of your final Fusion Skills assessment. Think about what you learned in lab as you create that connection.

Your reflection is turned in directly to Canvas.
