## ENGR102 Lab #5

This document is intended to describe the details of activities that will take place during this lab. Deliverables are items that you will each turn in (as a document) or demonstrate (to your instructor) to recieve full credit for the lab.

Generally any worksheets that you need for lab will be provided at the lab. I have linked the documents for any other potential users.

For the lab you will be working with the .stl files and the shop drawings you have created for the toy block project. The first block is precisely the one that Kevin Kennedy guided you to create in your first tutorial. The second block is one that results from updating your toy block model for this weeks [Fusion Skills Assessment (FusionSkills4)](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/Fusion360/Skills/FusionSkills4.md)

### Activity 1: Print Toy Blocks

Using the .stl files from your original toy block and your updated toy block print at least one copy of each. Consider how you will keep track of which block is which given their similarities. Make suitable choices given that your total available print time is roughly an hour.

**BRIM!**

Given the small footprint of your block brims are encouraged.

### Activity 2: Engineering Assessment

Take your two blocks and see how the fit with real 'lego bricks'. Consider tightness with each other and the standard lego bricks. Remember there are several orientations to check to full assess the fit.

### Activity 3: Reflection

Describe clearly how your toy blocks fit with traditional bricks. Offer thoughtful explanations for why the fit is loose or tight or just right in different orientations. What are the primary differences that affect the fit between Kevin's block and Chris 

Your reflection is turned in directly to Canvas.
