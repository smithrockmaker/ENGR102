## ENGR102 Lab #2

This document is intended to describe the details of activities that will take place during this lab. Deliverables are items that you will each turn in (as a document) or demonstrate (to your instructor) to recieve full credit for the lab.

Generally any worksheets that you need for lab will be provided at the lab. I have linked the documents for any other potential users.

For the lab you will be working with [Another_Hollow_Cube.stl](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/3DPrinters/stlFiles/test/Another_Hollow_Cube.stl) as your model file.

### Activity 1: Intro to Prusa Slicer

Using the resources presented in class to complete the [Prusa Slicer Intro](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/documents/Assessments/PusaSlicerIntro.docx).

### Activity 2: Define Print Features: Performance Characteristics

Continue with previous worksheet to explore setting various performance characteristics of the print like brims, speed, filament, and temperatures. While there is certainly overlap between these characteristics and engineering characteristics these primarily affect how the printer operates.

### Activity 3: Scaling and Slicing

Continue with worksheet ot explore scaling and slicing the 

### Activity 4: Export gcode to SD card.

Now that you have some sense of the options and settings in Prusa Slicer it's time to export the appropriate G-code to an SD card to print.

#### Activity 5: Print the "Hollow Cube" and Assess characteristics

Revisit your lab from last week before printing to be sure you know what to expect. After that review print your "Hollow Cube" gcode file from the SD card. Use this [Print Assessment Worksheet]() to assesss the characteristics of the printed "Hollow Cube"

### Activity 6: Reflection

Submit a short paragraph (Canvas or hardcopy) reflecting on your observations of the printing process. If you find that you have any questions feel free to ask in this context. Consider commenting on the compliant structure in the print or print quality issues (strings, nubs, holes).
