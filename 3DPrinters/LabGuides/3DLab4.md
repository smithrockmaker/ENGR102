## ENGR102 Lab #4

This document is intended to describe the details of activities that will take place during this lab. Deliverables are items that you will each turn in (as a document) or demonstrate (to your instructor) to recieve full credit for the lab.

Generally any worksheets that you need for lab will be provided at the lab. I have linked the documents for any other potential users.

For the lab you will be working with an .stl file from [articulated folder](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/3DPrinters/stlFiles/articulated/) as your model file.

### Activity 1: Choose Articulated Model

Choose an .stl file from those in the articulated folder on the github (linked above). All of these models create objects with interlocking moveable parts. Most take around an hour to print at 0.3mm with no brim. Slice your chosen object, be sure it prints in about an hour or less, and export the G-code to an SD card. Get it started on a printer or identify which printer you're in line for.

**NO BRIM!**

Refer to previous lab materials if you're unsure about the printing process.

### Activity 2: Reverse Engineering

While your object is printing return to slicer. Look down through the layers to understand how the print interlocks the parts so they move but stay together. You can make some reasonable estimates of the width of any gaps from the extruder paths as well as the shape of the interlocking parts. Sketch the shape of those interlocking parts so you COULD implement it in Fusion. Your sketch should provide all the detail you need to create your own test version of the object.

This sketch will be scanned and turned into Canvas directly.

### Activity 3: Assess the Success of the Print

When your group completes it's print **be sure to clean up** all the plastic bits at the printer before moving on to explore how the articulated object moves. Does it bind in certain places? Does it loosen up with wear? What is the range of motion for a given trapped object?

### Activity 4: Reflection

Reverse engineering is a real job but more importantly it's a way of learning from what others have done. What did you learn about your skills in reverse engineering as you tried to figure out how someone else created an articulating joint? How might you improve your skills at reverse engineering?

Your reflection is turned in directly to Canvas.
