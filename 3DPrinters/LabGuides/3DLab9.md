## ENGR102 Lab #9

This document is intended to describe the details of activities that will take place during this lab. Deliverables are items that you will each turn in (as a document) or demonstrate (to your instructor) to recieve full credit for the lab.

Generally any worksheets that you need for lab will be provided at the lab. I have linked the documents for any other potential users.

For the lab you will be working with an .stl file from [articulated folder](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/3DPrinters/stlFiles/snapfit/) as your model file.

### Activity 1: Choose Snap Fit Model

Choose an .stl file from those in the compliant folder on the github (linked above). All of these models create objects with different common snap fit structures. This particular set of prints was created by [Kaje](https://www.printables.com/@kaje) from a report from an MIT class on making things in 2012. The important link is to whats called the Bayer Manual for Snap Fi

**BRIMS:** One of the big challenges with these structures are the thin walls that form the compliant structures. Brims are generally NOT used in these circumstances BUT adhesion tends to be a problem for the small structures. Clean the print bed well and pay attention as the print starts and progresses. Be ready to stop and restart the print if needed.


### Activity 2: Scale and Print the Model

As usual....

### Activity 3: Assess the Success of the Print

When your group completes it's print **be sure to clean up** all the plastic bits at the printer before moving on to explore how the compliant object behaves. Does it bind in certain places? Does it break with wear? What is the range of motion?

### Activity 4: Reflection

Compliant strutures tend to NOT scale well. What would you change if you had access to the Fusion model for the object to be able to print it successfully at a smaller scale? What have you learned about compliant structures from this lab?

Your reflection is turned in directly to Canvas.
