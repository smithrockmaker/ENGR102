## CAD/Fusion Week 8

**Topic:** 

As we move into this weeks topics with Kevin you may feel like the focus is moving from basic skills and tools to broader ideas about creating models that can be easily modified or adapted in some way. Thinking of many objects of interest as assemblies of bodies that we might want to change in the future affects how we design the item. How we use various dimensions and constraints to keep some features fixed while allowing others to change.
