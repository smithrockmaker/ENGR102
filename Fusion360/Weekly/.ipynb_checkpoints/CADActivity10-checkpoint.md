### Notes from Day 20,21,23 -- LAST WEEK!!

[Learn Fusion 360 in 30 Days: Day 20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYDJLdOV_zE&list=PLrZ2zKOtC_-C4rWfapgngoe9o2-ng8ZBr&index=21) 9:20

**Hinged Box (3D print):**

This one is one of those fun ones where everything seems to work pretty much like demonstrated. 

Nice to reuse the project command and to think about where we create new bodies within components.

We might have imagined a cylindrical hinge pin but the conical one makes lots of sense as well. 

Note that he is printing this box as a single object laying on the build plate as you see it in the Fusion model It would be interesting to see how the hinges print.

20 min for me

**3D Printable Mold:**

This one is interesting. I'm not sure how effective this sort of mold might be with PLA that we print in lab but perhaps with suitable release agents it would work OK

General process of tutorial went smoothly. I did have one of my usual problems with the nesting of bodies and sketches. It is apparent that I need to think a little more clearly about the distinction between bodies and components. When do I use each in building a model. I suspect some of this will get more clear in the next tutorial about assemblies.

Also 20 min for me

### NOTE: Skipping to Day 23!!

**Assemblies:**

Nice that this exercise is built around a model that comes with the Fusion install:)

The 'Ground' command has been changed to 'Pin' in newer versions of Fusion. Who'd a thunk:)

The usual caveats about minimums and maximums that often seem to need to be reversed in my version of Fusion. 

60 min for me - long but useful!!
