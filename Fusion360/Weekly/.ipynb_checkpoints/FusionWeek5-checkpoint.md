## CAD/Fusion Week 4

**Topic:** 

From here on out we'll mostly focus on Kevin Kennedy's tutorials. Just to mess things up this week I'm suggesting that we do one of them out of order so we can develop a tool we need for the course. Being able to create engineering/shop drawings from our models is a useful tool for communicating.  

**CAD Learning**

We're going to

Day 29 from Kevin: This goes through the basics of creating a 2D drawing (engineering or shop drawing) from your Day 1 'Lego' Brick. This is out of order but will help us with our class work.

Day 4 from Kevin explores using the lofting tools to create a bottle.

Day 5 reviews some of the patterning processes along with other processes through designing an ice cube tray.

**CAD Deliverables**

Create specified electrical box to demonstrate your growing skills.
[Fusion Skills 3:](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/Fusion360/Skills/FusionSkills3.md) The skills assessment for this week is focused on using various tools (shells, construction planes, chamfers) along with sketches and extrusions to create a model of a single gang electrical box. I feel like the checklist I created for an earlier Fusion Skills Assessments is a little superflous so I am dropping them unless you convince me it is valuable.
