### Notes from Day 29,4,5

**2D Drawings:**

It appears that you do have access to the Automatic option for creating your drawing with your education license. Having tried it I strongly recommend AGAINST it! The Automatic option overpopulates the drawing with many dimensions and places them in ways which are visually confusing. Stick with the Manual mode as you are learning how to communicate with the folks at the fabrication end of the process (which is also you:)

Recognize that one doesn't always need all of the standard projections to fully define the model. Including the isometric view somewhere on the drawing is generally good practice especially for us.

Very handy to be able to do a detail view.

For our purposes we will export these drawings as pdf files that can be submitted to Canvas.

**Lofted Bottle:**

This all went pretty smoothly for me. I did have one point where I didn't smoothly join the rail to the profile and I got complaints. Went back and fixed the rail sketch and all was well.

**Egg Box:**

Also went smoothly. A couple of places I needed to connect various sketches more directly so the filleting would work. Generally pretty smooth.
