## CAD/Fusion Week 6

**Topic:** 

There are only two tutorials in this weeks assignment because the second one (phone case) everybody finds pretty challenging. It will be worth the time and effort to stick with it as best you can even if you're a little fuzzy at the end.  

**CAD Learning**

**LED Bulb:** This one works pretty well though some of the appearance stuff I found frustrating againn

**WARNING:** Everyone seems to find this next tutorial a bit challenging. Take your time. Some steps go by really fast and it is easy not to notice important details. Expect to spend some time here but it is worthwhile time and the next one is much simpler:) (10:00)
