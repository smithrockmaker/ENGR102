### Notes from Day 3

In case you need it the paperclip image is [here](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/images/FusionImages/Paperclip.jpg)

Generally this felt like it went pretty smoothly. Getting all the dimensions from the video is painful so pull up the image and have it available. Works much better. This set of skills shows up in a number of future videos

I felt like the first 1/2 to 2/3 of this video was helpful in terms of creating another component (the lid) and fitting it appropriately to the body of the conduit box. The work with the screws and importing them from the catalog felt useful but not central to my learning at this point. Feel free to skim this portion.
