### Notes from Day 1

[Day 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qGQ2utl2A&list=PLrZ2zKOtC_-C4rWfapgngoe9o2-ng8ZBr&index=2)

As many users have noted this 13 min video took me an hour or so to replicate. That is largely due to missed dimensions or small details about how the software works on my Mac as opposed to Kevin's (probably Windows?) machine. Here are some little things that I notice that may or may not be relevant but are learning moments for me.

Finishing an action like sketching a line or circle happens when I hit the return key rather than the esc key.

Regardless of what dimension I put in for a sketch object I can go back and double click that dimension to adjust it before finishing the sketch.

When I go to extrude I find it easier to select the face or object that I intend to work with before selecting the extrude command. I think this is just my lack of familiarity but could be something else. 

The rectangular patterning is very helpful though important to note that Kevin has precalculated the pattern distance ahead of time. The number of repetitions is obvious but the pattern distance is less clear. My exercise led to the 'bumps' not looking correctly spaced which turned out to be because I had a dimension wrong in the first sketch. Selected that first sketch from the timeline and fixed the dimension and all was well.

Rectangular pattern distance is the distance between analogous features on the first and last interation.

Good to know that patterning on the solid is wiser than patterning on the sketch generally.

Shell and Offset commands clearly helpful.

Note that I could go back now and modify the various sketches and pattern repeats to get a 2x6 block from this 2x8 drawing.

### Notes From Part 1

[Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5bc9c3S12g&list=PL40d7srwyc_Ow4aaOGXlP2idPGwD7ruKg)

As I noted in the weekly outline it seems prudent to explore this video AFTER the Kevin Kennedy video since Lars is using an older version (video is from 7 years ago). This will necessitate some reinterpretation of his descriptionsa and menu options. Good practice to go find the menu item and any changes to nomenclature.

What Lars calls the Model environment is now called the Design environment.

Lars is very fond of various short cuts to get to particular command options. You may be a fan of keyboard shortcuts but I am not. I don't know that I have great reasons for my bias but I think it happens because I don't use most software all the time and I lose track of particular shortcuts. You may, of course, become a short cut giant if that is your desire. In class I will work from menus generally.

What Lars describes as relationships are currently described as constraints on the sketch menu at the top of the sketch window.

Remember that when your sketch turns black then it is fully defined. When it is blue there is some aspect of the sketch which is NOT fully defined.

Lars returns to examine various steps in the process via an edit process. You can get the same place by double clicking on the particular step of interest in the timeline along the bottom of your Fusion window.

After spending more time on the first of Kevin's videos I feel like this one with Lars went much more smoothly and I only needed 30-40 min to replicate his 20 min video.

Onwards!
