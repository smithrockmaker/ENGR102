## CAD/Fusion Week 5

**Topic:** 

Back in order with Kevin Kennedy's tutorials.   

**CAD Learning**

The basic model of the hex nut is pretty straight forward here but be careful working with the projected information. It is easy to project onto planes to don't lead to the chamfering that is desired. (7:30)

**WARNING:** Everyone seems to find this tutorial a bit challenging. Take your time. Some steps go by really fast and it is easy not to notice important details. Expect to spend some time here but it is worthwhile time and the next one is much simpler:) (10:00)

This one will feel lik a relief after the previous one. Enjoy. The drafting command is clearly valuable to be aware of. (11:45)

**CAD Deliverables**

Create an initial shop drawing from the Day 1 Toy Block lesson. Then you will go back into your model and adjust parameters to match the formal 'lego' block dimensions. Both models (save separately!!) will be printed in lab. [Fusion Skills 4:](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/Fusion360/Skills/FusionSkills4.md)
