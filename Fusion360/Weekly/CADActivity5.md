**Handlebar Grip:**

Lots of parts that took some fussing for me.

I had to play with the Appearance command a bit to get how to apply it just to the second body (the aluminum ring at the end). 

Took a little fussing to select the right plane at the end of the rings to make the sketch to create a backdrop for the text. Eventually found it. 

To select the text which is buried inside the handle I found I had to turn off all of the other sketches (select the 'eye' to turn off all the other sketches) This made the Mountaineer text easy to select and then proceed with the lesson.

Because Kevin is not showing the whole drop down list of the bodies and sketches I wasn't completely sure what he did. I was having no luck changing the appearance of the text until I realized he had created a new 'body' when he made that extrusion/push/pull. Fusion actually creates a separate body for each letter of the text. Once I did that I could apply the new appearance to the text.

Finally -- took about an hour for me to do this one and sort out my mistakes.

**Door Stop:**

Draft command seems quite useful. Also interesting to create an object from bodies rather than extruded sketches. Not sure yet what the drivers are that would make me choose one method over the other.

This tutorial went a bit smoother than the previous one. Nothing that seemed to work totally differently than Kevin was presenting.

I'm finding that it helps to wrtie down various dimensions so that I can more smoothly implement my version of the tutorial without having to constantly refer back to the video.

**LED Bulb:**

Kevin has a preference set (that wasn't set in my preferences) that projects various lines automatically. Go to Preferences (under your avatar in top right) and then General>Design and near the top of the page is an option to 'Auto project edges on reference'. Select that and click OK. This will give you the reference lines that show up in Kevin's video.

Creating the various shapes and even threads feels more and more comfortable. Apply appearances to various parts of a model is really aggravating. 

I am also a bit aggravated about the location of the rotation center for the object. Kevin's works a little differently which sometimes makes it hard for me to find the same surfaces. I'll bet there is a preference someplace that I don't know about. 

Otherwise....good.
