**Hex Nut:**

Noticed as this video started that Kevins description of the various planes and axes in his system are rotated from the default settings for my system. This led to a confusion at the chamfer step that took some time to clarify in my own mind.

Also started smoothly but ran into issues creating the sketch to revolve to create the chamfer on the nut. After some fussing and figuring out a more complicated way of replicating what Kevin did I realized that my problem was related to the axis orientation comment from before. The 'back' plane of the origin system (X-Y in my system) cuts through the center of the nut. If I turn off the body and select that 'back' plane to sketch on than everything works. I had been sketching on one of the nut faces which was NOT working.

Everything else went well.

**Handlebar Grip:**

Lots of parts that took some fussing for me.

I had to play with the Appearance command a bit to get how to apply it just to the second body (the aluminum ring at the end). 

Took a little fussing to select the right plane at the end of the rings to make the sketch to create a backdrop for the text. Eventually found it. 

To select the text which is buried inside the handle I found I had to turn off all of the other sketches (select the 'eye' to turn off all the other sketches) This made the Mountaineer text easy to select and then proceed with the lesson.

Because Kevin is not showing the whole drop down list of the bodies and sketches I wasn't completely sure what he did. I was having no luck changing the appearance of the text until I realized he had created a new 'body' when he made that extrusion/push/pull. Fusion actually creates a separate body for each letter of the text. Once I did that I could apply the new appearance to the text.

Finally -- took about an hour for me to do this one and sort out my mistakes.

**Door Stop:**

Draft command seems quite useful. Also interesting to create an object from bodies rather than extruded sketches. Not sure yet what the drivers are that would make me choose one method over the other.

This tutorial went a bit smoother than the previous one. Nothing that seemed to work totally differently than Kevin was presenting.

I'm finding that it helps to wrtie down various dimensions so that I can more smoothly implement my version of the tutorial without having to constantly refer back to the video.
