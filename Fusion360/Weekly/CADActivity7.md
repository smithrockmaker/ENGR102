**Dog Bowl:**

Even though this video has lots of new stuff it moves very smoothly and I had no real issues.

Slowly getting better at adding appearances.

The section analysis tool from the Inspection menu is very cool and important. The fact that it creates a section view which is stored in the browser is fabulous!! We will definitely use this later.

**Custom Helix:**

Kevin's guidance is great on this one. He anticipates and resolves all the issues that came up for me. 

I had to fuss a little to get the coil to go up rather than down. 

Projecting the bottom surface of the pipe to allow the loft command to avoid the corner of the helix was a cool fix. 

It was apparent a couple of time in this tutorial that getting geometry errors is not uncommon when creating models in Fusion. Not getting flustered and trying some options to clarify the geometry seems to be key to getting past the errors. To me what this means is I need to collect possible tools for fixing geometry in the back of my mind so I can try these techniques when I run into a problem with my own designs. Probably won't happen until long after I have forgotten these tutorials which is why these notes will ultimately be helpful.

It may have something to do with the plane on which I drew the original centerline sketch but the chamfer didn't work in the same order that Kevin's did. I had to reverse the 3mm and 5mm parameters.

All in all cool since I have an auger much like this out back by the barn.

**Assemblies:**

In some sense this is an 'easy' tutorial since it isn't creating a model. It is just describing the language of assemblies and components in Fusion 360. I suspect that Kevin is right that I should listen/watch this video several times to embed it in my brain. The reality is that I am going to move on and remember that when I get confused in a couple of lessons I'm going to come back here to make sense of things. Whew!!
