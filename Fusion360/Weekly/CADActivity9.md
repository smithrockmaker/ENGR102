**Sketch Constraints:**

The one real issue for me in this was accessing the Fusion file that Kevin provided. The issue is that the college's email refuses to download the link due to it's usual anxieties about network security. I have zipped the file up and made it available on the github. Hopefully it will remain readable

This is a great review of sketch constraints. We've used many of these already but it's helpful to see them all strung together.

The curvature constraint is one I hadn't used before. I love the cool curvature visualization. I suspect it has meaning that I don't yet appreciate.

Helpful to know how to display all the various sketch constraints associated with particular features. I can see using that from time to time.

20 min for me
