## Fusion Skills Assessment

### Sketching

Most sketches that you will need are likely to be very simple. Circles, rectangles, hexagons, etc. The following tasks ask you to explore some slightly more complex forms. Place each sketch on one of the principle planes of a Fusion project. No extruding or othe tasks are asked. Be sure you've used the dimension tool to define the relevant dimensions.

### Task 1:

Create a new component and label it Sketch1: Create a sketch matching the following image on one of the principle planes of your project.

<img src="../../images/FusionAssess/Exercise1-1.jpg" />

### Task 2:

Create a new component and label it Sketch2:Create a sketch matching the following image on a different principle plane of your project.

<img src="../../images/FusionAssess/Exercise1-2.jpg" />

### Task 3:

Examine the object provided in class and choose a feature that would require a sketch that is not a simple circle or rectangle. Get your choice approved by the instructor.

**3a:** Create a paper and pencil sketch of the feature with appropriate measurements.  This will guide the sketch you create in Fusion

**3b:** Create a new component and label it Sketch3: Create a sketch in Fusion (on the remaining principle plane of your project.

### Task 4: 

Save your Fusion project to a local file named 'FusionSkills1(First name)(Last name)'. Insert your first and last name with first letters capitalized. Note that this should be a local file in case you need to submit it to your instructor.

### Instructor Verification

Each of the tasks above will be validated and initialed by your instructor in lab (or in another setting if needed). Use [this checklist](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/Fusion360/Checklists/FusionSkills1Checklist.docx) to track those validations. When your checklist is complete physically turn it in to your instructor.
