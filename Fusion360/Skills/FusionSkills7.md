## Fusion Skills Assessment: 7 (Last One!!)

### Latching case for Raspberry Pi

This tutorial has lots of overlaps with previous tutorials. It is a long one (35 min) which is why this will be a good representation of your skills development with Fusion 360. Part of what I am assessing here is how you adapt what Kevin does in this tutorial from 5 years ago when Fusion had different menus and icons.

The CAD model for the Raspberry Pi is in a zipped file on the github [here]()

**NOTE:** Because this is a more complex model than many we have done I will be asking you to turn in a number of different screen shots. Read the Deliverables carefully:)

### Task 1:

Create your own version of the latching case for a Raspberry Pi including all of the features that Kevin includes. Some of the penetrations you can do in different ways if you want though the USB ports on the end need to be projected as Kevin does. 

### Task 2:

I feel like I shouldn't have to say this but I'm going to for clarity. There are a number of sections, bodies, construction planes, and sketches that are part of this model. Be sure that you have clearly labeled all of them and the browser structure is fully displayed. Incomplete labelling will get your submission returned to you.

### Deliverable 1:

For this screen shot I want all sketches visible, top and bottom bodies are transparent, and all sketches are turned on. Turn off the visibility of the Raspberry Pi

### Task 3:

Sweep the slide body profile you have created along the line defining the shape of the slide. Stop the sweep roughly 5% from the end of the slide (I just want to see that you know how to control how far your sweep goes) Think about how I will know that this is what you did.

### Task 4:

The image shows three (3) sets of supports under the slide. Create a new component and design just one (1) of the three supports. I don't care which one or whether you use square or circular tubes for the braces. Remmeber to label all of your sketches and bodies approriately. You are demonstrating to be your ability to organize your Fusion models in a way which makes them easier for others to use and understand.


### Assessment Verification

For this assessment take a screen shot of your completed slide and submit it to Canvas. **Remember to turn on all of the bodies, sketches, and construction planes so they are visible in your screenshot.** Please refer to this [Fusion Screenshot Expectations](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/Fusion360/ScreenShotExpectations.md) document for guidance.
