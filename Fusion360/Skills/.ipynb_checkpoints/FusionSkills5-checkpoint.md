## Fusion Skills Assessment: 5

### Revolve, Circular Pattern, Pipe, Trim

This exercise will use a number of tools from Kevin's tutorials. Here is the shop drawing (there will be some modifications) of a chess piece (the castle or rook). Remember all of our expectations about the screen shot you will turn in for this exercise. This chess piece is roughly 10x the size of an actual chess piece (205 mm tall is about 8 inches) but don't worry about that:)

### Task 1:

Create a closed sketch on an appropriate plane that captures the core profile of the rook. At this point there should be no fillets anywhere though the base of the rook has a circular bulge of a specific radius. Check your dimensions as you are building this sketch since you will be revolving it around the verticle axis. Many of the dimensions you need are half of what is on the shop drawing.

### Task 2:

Once you have the sketch revolve it around the vertical axis. This will give you the core shape of the rook. At this point all the corners should be square except for the circular profile at base of tower.

### Task 3:

Create a new sketch on the top plane of the rook and make a circular (60 mm diameter) 30 mm deep depression in the top of the rook. This is NOT shown on the shop drawing.

### Task 4:

Create another sketch on the top plane (a separate sketch) for the turret cut out. From a fabrication point of view the slot will have a rectangular shape when viewed from above. Don't worry too much about the 15mm between the cutouts. Extrude this sketch to create the first turret cutout.

### Task 5:

Using the circular pattern tool create 12 turrets around the edge of the rook. Notice that because the cutout is rectangular the turrets themselves are trapezoidal.

### Task 6:

Fillet the top edge of the base of the rook to match the shop drawing. The inverted fillet is formed by using the pipe command applied to the edge on the underside of the top portion of the rook. You will probably need to play with the pipe diameter a little to get the proper result. This will leave you with a fillet AND a pipe icon as the last two steps in your timeline.


### Assessment Verification

For this assessment take a screen shot of your completed rook and submit it to Canvas. **Remember to turn on all of the bodies, sketches, and construction planes so they are visible in your screenshot.** Please refer to this [Fusion Screenshot Expectations](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/Fusion360/ScreenShotExpectations.md) document for guidance.
