## Fusion Skills Assessment: 7 (Last One!!)

### Latching case for Raspberry Pi

[Latching Case for Raspberry Pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0NVC8xhf3I&list=PLrZ2zKOtC_-B40OCy15MRRXtsBTjgVR44)

This tutorial has lots of overlaps with previous tutorials. It is a long one (35 min) which is why this will be a good representation of your skills development with Fusion 360. Part of what I am assessing here is how you adapt what Kevin does in this tutorial from 5 years ago when Fusion had different menus and icons.

The CAD (Fusion) model for the Raspberry Pi is in a zipped file on the github [here](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/documents/FusionDocs/RaspberryPi.f3d.zip)

**NOTE:** Because this is a more complex model than many we have done I will be asking you to turn in a number of different screen shots. Read the Deliverables carefully:)

### Task 1:

Create your own version of the latching case for a Raspberry Pi including all of the features that Kevin includes. Some of the penetrations you can do in different ways if you want though the USB ports on the end need to be projected as Kevin does. 

### Task 2:

I feel like I shouldn't have to say this but I'm going to for clarity. There are a number of sections, bodies, construction planes, and sketches that are part of this model. Be sure that you have clearly labeled all of them and the browser structure is fully displayed in all screen shots. Incomplete labelling will get your submission returned to you. If you do not have the 2 bodies, 8 sketches, 3 construction planes, and 3 section analyses that are part of the tutorial you will need to provide an explanation for why.

### Deliverable 1:

For this screen shot I want all sketches visible, top and bottom bodies are transparent, and all sketches are turned on. Turn off the visibility of the Raspberry Pi and orient your model so all of the sketches can be seen.

### Deliverable 2:

For this screen shot all the sketches are turned OFF, the Raspberry Pi is turned ON, the top half of the box is turned OFF. Turn on the WIDTH section analysis and edit it so the support posts that position the Raspberry Pi are visible in the cross section.

### Deliverable 3:

Top and Bottom bodies are turned ON. Raspberry Pi is turned ON. The Lengthwise cross section is turned on and edited to pass roughly through the middle of the box and opening for the SD Card. Reorient the model so the opening for the SD card can be seen as well as the cross section.

### Deliverable 4:

Top and Bottom bodies are turned ON. Raspberry Pi is turned ON. All construction planes are turned on and box is opaque. 

### Assessment Verification

Submit the 4 requested screen shots to Canvas before the end of the term. Please refer to this [Fusion Screenshot Expectations](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/Fusion360/ScreenShotExpectations.md) document for guidance.
