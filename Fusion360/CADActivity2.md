Overall a little smoother each time I dive into Fusion. I did download the image from Kevin's webpage to follow along with what he does.

I had to go back and forth a few times to get the image placed on the Canvas in a reasonable way. It was still a little off axis which makes my bottle look a little weird but hey who's judging!

I am always reminded that working with splined curves is it's own special aggravation. Moving the anchor points, moving the handles, etc etc. If you've never worked with such objects spend a little time just messing around to get different curves. All of the Adobe products use a similar curve manipulation model.

Not sure that I see great value in the Attributes part of this video but I acknowledge that it will be handy if I ever want to make a presentation from a drawing.

### Notes From Part 2

[Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXRMzJWo0-Q&t=2s)

My version of this video has German subtitles which is fun but not helpful for me:)

I still have to fiddle a little bit to get sketch dimensions specified but it's coming into focus. After they are spec'd I also take a moment to position them for visibility and clarity.

Well, here's a fascinating issue that is noted in the comments. On his second cylindrical extrusion that cuts through the fillets on the 'end' the current version of the software doesn't work the same as his version. I tried a lot of things and clearly so did other viewers. Nothing I tried in terms of replicating Lars' process worked for me. It always left a gap between the fillet and the cylinder. What I eventually found that worked is to extrude the circle INWARDS and constrain it to hit the inner wall. THEN extrude the second side 18 mm away from the body. Not clear why that works but it does. Welcome to the irritating world of software that always changes.

In the current version of Fusion the mirror command is on the Solid > Create dropdown menu near the bottom. 

The ability to reorder the operations by dragging items along the timeline is very cool. I'm not sure I'll remember it when I need it but it's clearly important. Also fun to rewatch the process by stepping through the timeline. I would expect that individual timelines might look quite different for different operators working on the same object.

When extruding the screw holes down into the ends I found it didn't work to try and do them one at a time. Worked fine if I selected both circles from the sketch and extruded them both down 8 mm at the same time.

The thread command is also on the Solid > Create dropdown menu but near the middle.

Resolving the extrusion through the fillet issue took a fair amount of time but probably only an hour or so to
