### Current Plan for Fusion/CAD portion of ENGR 102
### 1/2/25

### Instructional Model: 

As opposed to an actual CAD class ([CIS 135S1](https://catalog.cocc.edu/course-outlines/cis-135s1/) or [ENGR248](https://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/soc/ecatalog/ecoursedetail.htm?subject=ENGR&coursenumber=248)) this course seeks to introduce CAD tools in the context of engineering design and fabrication. The focus here will be basic skills combined with finding and learning new tools as they are suggested by the projects. Fusion360 (Autodesk) will be the tool of choice though students with experience with other packages AND access to software may adapt the exercises.

([FusionLicense Guide](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/Fusion360/FusionLicense.md)): Just a reminder of the process to get your Fusion Client installed.

### Week 1:

**Topic:** 

Primary focus for this week is creating sketches that are the basis of 3D modeling.

**CAD Learning**

Day 1 from Kevin: This is a quick start to understanding how to work in Fusion 360. Be sure and follow along and create your own version of the design. We will be using this elsewhere in the course soon. 13 min

Part I from Lars: Different approach but also gets you many skills in short order. Be aware that he is using an older version of Fusion 360 so the tools and menus look a little different. That is intentional on my part and good practice for you. 20 min
[Fusion 360 for Absolute Beginners: Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5bc9c3S12g)

**CAD Deliverables**

None for this week. Getting everything up and running as well as going through the first lessons will lead to next weeks deliverables.

**Unresolved:** 

### Week 2:

**Topic**

Primary focus for this week is working with extrusions with attention to parametric design.

**CAD Learning**

Day 2 from Kevin: Extruding by revolving is useful as well as working with images and splined curves.  12 min

Part 2 from Lars: Continuing with the conduit box. 19 min

**CAD Deliverables**

[Fusion Skills 1:](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/Fusion360/Skills/FusionSkills1.md) The skills assessment for this week is focused on creating and dimensioning sketches. [This checklist](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/Fusion360/Skills/Checklists/FusionSkills1Checklist.docx) will verify successful demonstration of the skills to your instructor.

**Unresolved:** 

Still trying to sort out best practice for turning in or demonstrating Fusion skills. For now demonstrating those skillls directly to the instructor will be used.

### Week 3:

**Topic:** 

Sweeping shapes is focus of Kevin's tutorial. Lars explores assembling multiple components (lid on box). 

**CAD Learning**

Even though we don't have class on Monday there is plenty of time to stay on track with developing your Fusion skills.

Day 3 from Kevin: Cool to learn about sweeping.

Part 3 from Lars: Finishing the Conduit Box: (part 3). Feels good to finish the box. Adding the screws is irritating. Don't get stuck on that part as it is not high value at this moment.

### Week 4:

**Topic:** 

Engineering/shop drawings:

**CAD Learning**

Day 29 from Kevin: This goes through the basics of creating a 2D drawing (engineering or shop drawing) from your Day 1 'Lego' Brick. This is out of order but will help us with our class work.

Day 4 from Kevin explores using the lofting tools to create a bottle.

Create specified electrical box to demonstrate your growing skills.
[Fusion Skills 3:](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/Fusion360/Skills/FusionSkills3.md) The skills assessment for this week is focused on creating and dimensioning sketches. I feel like the checklist I created for an earlier Fusion Skills Assessment is a little superflous so I am dropping them unless you convince me it is valuable.

**Unresolved:**

### Week 5:

**Topic:** 

Back in order with Kevin Kennedy's tutorials.   

**CAD Learning**

The basic model of the hex nut is pretty straight forward here but be careful working with the projected information. It is easy to project onto planes to don't lead to the chamfering that is desired. (7:30)

**WARNING:** Everyone seems to find this next tutorial a bit challenging. Take your time. Some steps go by really fast and it is easy not to notice important details. Expect to spend some time here but it is worthwhile time and the next one is much simpler:) (10:00)

[Learn Fusion 360 in 30 Days: Day 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv54UfwYYos&list=PLrZ2zKOtC_-C4rWfapgngoe9o2-ng8ZBr&index=8)

This one will feel lik a relief after the previous one. Enjoy. The drafting command is clearly valuable to be aware of. (11:45)

**CAD Deliverables**

Create an initial shop drawing from the Day 1 Toy Block lesson. Then you will go back into your model and adjust parameters to match the formal 'lego' block dimensions. Both models (save separately!!) will be printed in lab. [Fusion Skills 4:](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/Fusion360/Skills/FusionSkills4.md) 
### Week 6:

**Topic:** 

There are only two tutorials in this weeks assignment because the second one (phone case) everybody finds pretty challenging. It will be worth the time and effort to stick with it as best you can even if you're a little fuzzy at the end.  

**CAD Learning**

**LED Bulb:** This one works pretty well though some of the appearance stuff I found frustrating againn

[Learn Fusion 360 in 30 Days: Day 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YaMulL4dZY) 7:24

**WARNING:** Everyone seems to find this next tutorial a bit challenging. Take your time. Some steps go by really fast and it is easy not to notice important details. Expect to spend some time here but it is worthwhile time and the next one is much simpler:) (10:00)

**Phone Case:**

**[Bruce's Notes:](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/Fusion360/Weekly/CADActivity6.md)**

**CAD Deliverables**

No CAD deliverables this week as you begin work on your Project #1

### Week 7:

**Topic:** 

This week should feel pretty good in the sense that many of the tasks that Kevin is going over are variations on past lessons. I hope you find these more satisfying after the challenge of the Phone Case.

**CAD Deliverables**

Create a Fusion model of a chess piece (the rook) according to specifications.
[Fusion Skills 5:](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/Fusion360/Skills/FusionSkills5.md) The skills assessment for this week is focused on using the revolve tool, circular patterning, basic extrusions, and the pipe tool.
**Unresolved:** 

### Week 8:

**Topic:** 

As we move into this weeks topics with Kevin you may feel like the focus is moving from basic skills and tools to broader ideas about creating models that can be easily modified or adapted in some way. Thinking of many objects of interest as assemblies of bodies that we might want to change in the future affects how we design the item. How we use various dimensions and constraints to keep some features fixed while allowing others to change. 

**CAD Learning**

**Screwdriver Assembly:**

**CAD Deliverables**

Creating construction planes, sweeping along lines, creating new components, and making reasonable judgements about scale.[Fusion Skills 6:](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/Fusion360/Skills/FusionSkills6.md) The skills assessment for this week is focused on sketching, construction pla nes, organizing your model, sweeping along a profile, and making appropriate judgements.

**Unresolved:** 

### Week 9:

**Topic:** 

Again, more of the learning and discussion here is about how to more effectively use the tools in Fusion to create models which are more easily adapted and managed. As usually I'm sure you're thinking of different situations in which the skills you are learning can be applied.

**CAD Learning**

**Sketch Constraints:**
