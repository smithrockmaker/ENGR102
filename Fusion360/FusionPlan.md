### Current Plan for Fusion/CAD portion of ENGR 102
### 1/2/25

### Instructional Model: 

As opposed to an actual CAD class ([CIS 135S1](https://catalog.cocc.edu/course-outlines/cis-135s1/) or [ENGR248](https://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/soc/ecatalog/ecoursedetail.htm?subject=ENGR&coursenumber=248)) this course seeks to introduce CAD tools in the context of engineering design and fabrication. The focus here will be basic skills combined with finding and learning new tools as they are suggested by the projects. Fusion360 (Autodesk) will be the tool of choice though students with experience with other packages AND access to software may adapt the exercises.

([FusionLicense Guide](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/Fusion360/FusionLicense.md)): Just a reminder of the process to get your Fusion Client installed.

### Week 1:

**Topic:** 

Primary focus for this week is creating sketches that are the basis of 3D modeling.

**CAD Learning**

Day 1 from Kevin: This is a quick start to understanding how to work in Fusion 360. Be sure and follow along and create your own version of the design. We will be using this elsewhere in the course soon. 13 min

Part I from Lars: Different approach but also gets you many skills in short order. Be aware that he is using an older version of Fusion 360 so the tools and menus look a little different. That is intentional on my part and good practice for you. 20 min

**CAD Deliverables**

None for this week. Getting everything up and running as well as going through the first lessons will lead to next weeks deliverables.

**Unresolved:** 

### Week 2:

**Topic**

Primary focus for this week is working with extrusions with attention to parametric design.

**CAD Learning**

Day 2 from Kevin: Extruding by revolving is useful as well as working with images and splined curves.  12 min

**CAD Deliverables**

[Fusion Skills 1:](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/Fusion360/Skills/FusionSkills1.md) The skills assessment for this week is focused on creating and dimensioning sketches. [This checklist](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/Fusion360/Skills/Checklists/FusionSkills1Checklist.docx) will verify successful demonstration of the skills to your instructor.

**Unresolved:** 

Still trying to sort out best practice for turning in or demonstrating Fusion skills. For now demonstrating those skillls directly to the instructor will be used.

### Week 3:
