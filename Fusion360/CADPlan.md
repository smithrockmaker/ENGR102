### Current Plan for CAD portion of ENGR 102
### 10/23/24

### Instructional Model: 

As opposed to an actual CAD class (CIS 135S1) this course seeks to introduce CAD tools in the context of engineering design and fabrication. The focus here will be basic skills combined with finding and learning new tools as they are suggested by the projects. Fusion360 (Autodesk) will be the tool of choice though students with experience with other packages AND access to software adapt the exercises.

### Week 1:

**Topic:** Overview of CAD tools, setting up Fusion360 account, download client on personal computers. 

**Outcomes:** Verify access to Fusion360 or equivalent tool by end of week.

**Class:** General discussion

**Lab:** Solve account and client issues as possible.

**Unresolved:** 

### Week 2:

**Topic:** Creating sketches (cross sections), Deconstructing objects into potential sketches, using constraints

Lines, arcs, circles, constraints, symmetry, and dimensions.

**Outcomes:** Generate a number of sketches using basic tools and constraints. 

**Class:** Presentation of tools

**Lab:** Execution of first exercises, exploration of additional exercises or take them home. Visualizing cross sections

**Unresolved:** How best to assure students are doing their own work? Encourage sharing of insights but also personal practice.
