* **Engineering Design:** There are a lot of different ways to think about engineering design. One group whose approach to design I particularly admire is the [D Lab at MIT](https://d-lab.mit.edu/). A couple of things about this video before we look at it. Most of you are aware of TED and the TED videos but this video is from 2006 while it was still a conference of 400 people in an auditorium in Monterey CA. Amy had recently (2004) been awarded the MacArthur Grant (genius award!) for the work she is describing here. In spite of that she was a part time instructor at MIT running the D Lab in the basement of a nearly condemned building on campus. She's clearly nervous giving this talk but it describes a particular form of engineering design that you might be interested in. [Amy Smith](https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_smith_simple_designs_to_save_a_life?subtitle=en) After many years her program was eventually accepted into the credit curriculum at MIT and the D Lab is doing fascinating things around the world. A case in point is the [Second Life Innovations](https://d-lab.mit.edu/innovation-practice/design-second-life-innovations) to upcycle outdated technology to improve lives. 

* So, here is an engineering problem that used all of the tools described above to create a solution. [Extreme Engineering](https://hackaday.com/2024/12/04/rolling-your-own-ball-screws/)
