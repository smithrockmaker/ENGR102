## Week 1 Content

Just a note this first time. This is how I intend to keep track of the various resources I intend to use in each week's classes. Given the potential disconnect between what I plan to do and what actually happens this document may well be updated after class happens. I make this resource available partly so that if you miss class or need to come back and revisit something you can do so.

### Day 1 (Monday)

### Syllabus, Plan, Grading, Roll Call

* All the usual stuff to go over quickly this first day. Point to Canvas content AND github. Note the DigitalResources page.

* Read the grade policy document and come with questions next time.

* Quick survey of computer access for students

* Why Fusion 360?

* How to get Fusion 360

* Why Prusa Slicer?

* How to get Prusa Slicer

* More Questions? Sign add slips.


### Day 2 (Wednesday)

* Discuss how this class fits into various engineering programs.

* Focus of class on learning how to learn

* Grade policy discussion

* **CAD Skills:** There are an overwhelming number of video options out there and it is very hard to choose among them. Based recommendations from my community of makers I have chosen two to use for this course. Kevin Kennedy and Lars Christensen. You are welcome to explore others but I offer no assurances about my ability to clarify whatever you see. Another source that I trust is MIT Open Courseware. The course [How to CAD Almost Anything](https://github.com/andyeske/How-to-CAD-Fusion-360?tab=readme-ov-file#S1) provides a different perspective. The link above is to the 2024 Fusion 360 version of the class.

* **3D Printing:** The 3D printing portion of this class is focused on manufacturing and engineering considerations and FDM (fused deposition modeling) is an inexpensive and accessible way to consider a range of fabrication issues. I would note that the Deschutes Public Library system will be adding makerspaces in it's new building and you will have access to similar 3D printers to the ones we are using.

* Part of what links CAD and fabrication together is CAM (computer aided manufacturing). CAM is how we tell machines what to do and it turns out one of the general languages for doing so is gcode. Turns out that gcode also drives 3D printers. That makes gcode part of what you will experience here.

* **Engineering Design:** There are a lot of different ways to think about engineering design. One group whose approach to design I particularly admire is the [D Lab at MIT](https://d-lab.mit.edu/). A couple of things about this video before we look at it. Most of you are aware of TED and the TED videos but this video is from 2006 while it was still a conference of 400 people in an auditorium in Monterey CA. Amy had recently (2004) been awarded the MacArthur Grant (genius award!) for the work she is describing here. In spite of that she was a part time instructor at MIT running the D Lab in the basement of a nearly condemned building on campus. She's clearly nervous giving this talk but it describes a particular form of engineering design that you might be interested in. [Amy Smith](https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_smith_simple_designs_to_save_a_life?subtitle=en) After many years her program was eventually accepted into the credit curriculum at MIT and the D Lab is doing fascinating things around the world. A case in point is the [Second Life Innovations](https://d-lab.mit.edu/innovation-practice/design-second-life-innovations) to upcycle outdated technology to improve lives. 

* So, here is an engineering problem that used all of the tools described above to create a solution. [Extreme Engineering](https://hackaday.com/2024/12/04/rolling-your-own-ball-screws/)
