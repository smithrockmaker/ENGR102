## Week 1 Content

Just a note this first time. This is how I intend to keep track of the various resources I intend to use in each week's classes. Given the potential disconnect between what I plan to do and what actually happens this document may well be updated after class happens. I make this resource available partly so that if you miss class or need to come back and revisit something you can do so.

### Day 1 (Monday)

### Syllabus, Plan, Grading, Roll Call

All the usual stuff to go over quickly this first day.


### Day 2 (Wednesday)
