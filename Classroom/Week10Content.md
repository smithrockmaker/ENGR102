## Week 10 Content

All we are doing this week is practicing for the final and having time in lab to do prints and complete Fusion exercises

### Day 1 (Monday)

### Practice Final:

Next week is finals week. Since we haven't had any formal exams in this class it seemed respectful to give you a chance to experience what I am planning for the final. You will literally do this practice final in class today with collaboration and guidance from your instructor.
