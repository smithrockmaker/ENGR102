## Week 9 Content

This week we explore some of the basic ideas embedded in various 'lean' engineering and manufacturing processes. We continue developing our Fusion skills and will also explore compliant structures in 3D printing.

### Day 1 (Monday)

### Structured Problem Solving A3 Method (related to 'Lean')

As always I feel compelled to validate the relevance of the topic each week to your engineering development. The structured problem solving approach we will discuss today is most commonly associated with Industrial Engineering (we will discuss for a moment what you think IE is?). While you may think "I'm not planning to be an Industrial Engineer!" you should consider that managing processes is an integral part of almost any job. Heck, there is process management in teaching (which makes it an Industrial Engineering thing!) which we will explore today.

**Validation:** 

Montana State University's Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department (Duward Sobek II) received an NSF grant to explore the application of the Toyota Production System (including A3 Structured Problem solving) to the health care industry in Montana. [Here](https://www.montana.edu/dsobek/a3/ioc-grant/index.html) is a description of the grant. 

We will use a modified A3 framework that integrates the system used by Montana State with other similar versions. Here is a [link to the template](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/documents/LeanA3/A3Template.docx) I will hand out in class.

**The Problem:**

Here is the process problem I would like you all to consider (in groups): How could ENGR 102 be structured to reduce the number of students who fall significantly behind during the course.

It is important to note that one of the intended outcomes for this class is that each student recognizes their personal challenges to being 'self starting' and having 'effective time management skills'. Both of these are standard expectations for successful engineers (and other employees) across most industries. In addition many community college students are pursuing educational opportunities while working and/or having family responsibilities. The ability to manage time conflicts between these different responsibilities is important.

**The Process:**

**Step 1: Name the Problem/Background**

(i) Whenever the way work happens is not ideal, or when a goal or objective is not being met, you have a problem (or, if you prefer, a need). The best problems to work on are those that arise in day-to-day work and prevent you from doing your best.

(ii) The report’s background section conveys important related facts and how the problem aligns with the company’s strategic objectives. Presenting this right there on the page helps minimize the cost that a board of highly paid executives would need to spend looking at a problem, without a guarantee of them understanding it, nor coming up with the right solution. Consider this checklist for your background section:

(iii) The first step in the A3 Problem Solving process is to clearly and accurately define the problem. This is an important step because a clearly defined problem will help to ensure that the appropriate data is collected and solutions are developed. If the problem is not clearly defined, incorrect data may be collected, solutions that do not address the root cause of the problem, and time and resources may be wasted.

**Step 2: Current Condition**

(i) Before a problem can be properly addressed, one must have a firm grasp of the current situation. To do this, Toyota suggests that problem-solvers:

<blockquote>
    
* Observe the work processes first hand, and document one’s observations.
  
* Create a diagram that shows how the work is currently done.  Any number of formal process charting or mapping tools can be used, but often simple stick figures and arrows will do the trick.

* Quantify the magnitude of the problem (e.g., % of customer deliveries that are late, # of stock outs in a month, # of errors reported per quarter, % of work time that is value-added); if possible, represent the data graphically.

</blockquote>

(ii) A correct definition and a good understanding of the problem is your path to finding the right solution. That makes working on defining the current condition 90 % of the A3 effort.

The objective here is to make sure everyone is aware of the problem, whether the report documents it appropriately, and whether anyone questions the report’s findings. The use of graphs, charts, or other visual aids is beneficial.

(iii) Data collection is an important step in the A3 Problem Solving process because it allows organisations to gain a thorough understanding of the problem they are attempting to solve. This step entails gathering pertinent information about the problem, such as data on its origin, impact, and any related factors. This information is then used to help identify root causes and develop effective solutions.

**Step 3: Root Cause Analysis**

(i) Once you have a good understanding of how the process (i.e., the one that needs to be fixed) currently works, it's time to figure out what the root causes are to the errors or inefficiency. To accomplish this, first make a list of the main problem(s). Next, ask the appropriate "why?" questions until you reach the root cause. A good rule-of-thumb is that you haven't reached the root cause until you've asked "why?" at least five times in series.

(ii) The focus of the root cause section should be to differentiate between facts and opinions regarding a problem’s cause and effect. You can include your findings from [5 Whys](https://kanbantool.com/kanban-guide/5-whys) exercises, an [Ishikawa diagram](https://kanbantool.com/kanban-guide/fishbone-diagram), or any other result of your RCA (root cause analysis) efforts. If the root cause is not defined correctly, the problem will likely resurface, causing waste and negating the Lean principles.

(iii) The process of determining the underlying causes of a problem is known as root cause analysis. This process can assist organisations in determining why a problem is occurring and what can be done to prevent it from recurring in the future. The goal of root cause analysis is to identify the underlying cause of a problem rather than just its symptoms, allowing it to be addressed more effectively. (also references 5 Whys and Ishikawa diagrams)

**Step 4: Countermeasures/Target State**

(i) Once the current situation is fully understood and the root cause(s) for the main problem(s) has been unveiled, it’s time to devise some countermeasures. Countermeasures are the changes to be made to the work processes that will move the organization closer to ideal, or make the process more efficient, by addressing root causes.  

The countermeasure(s) addressing the root cause(s) of the problem will lead to new ways of getting the work done, what we call the target condition or target state. It describes how the work will get done with the proposed countermeasures in place.  In the A3 report, the target condition should be a diagram (similar to the current condition) that illustrates how the new proposed process will work.  The specific countermeasures should be noted or listed, and the expected improvement should be predicted specifically and quantitatively.

(ii) The countermeasures should be the corrective actions to take for the root cause of the problem to be resolved. If not possible - without a process overhaul - you can use containment actions instead to stop the issue from directly impacting the customer. It is OK to address complex problems iteratively, along with the values of continuous improvement.

Your target - if you hit it, you know that your problem-solving effort has been a success. But you need to know what metrics will measure success and what the definition of success is. 

(iii) Developing solutions is the fourth step in the A3 Problem Solving process. This entails generating ideas and options for dealing with the problem, followed by selecting the best solution. The goal is to develop a solution that addresses the root cause of the problem and prevents it from recurring.

(The development of solutions) is an iterative process in which options are generated and evaluated. The data gathered in the previous steps, as well as the insights and understanding gained from the root cause analysis, guide this process. The solution should be based on a thorough understanding of the problem and address the underlying cause.

**Step 5: Implementation Plan**

(i) In order to reach the target state, one needs a well thought-out and workable implementation plan. The implementation plan should include a list of the actions that need to be done to get the countermeasures in place and realize the target condition, along with the individual responsible for each task and a due date. Other relevant items, such as cost, may also be added.

(ii)

(iii) The final and most important step in the A3 Problem Solving methodology is solution implementation. This is the stage at which the identified and developed solutions are put into action to address the problem. This step’s goal is to ensure that the solutions are effective, efficient, and long-lasting.
The implementation Process

The implementation process entails putting the solutions developed in the previous step into action. This could include changes to processes, procedures, and systems, as well as employee training and education. To ensure that the solutions are effective, the implementation process should be well-planned and meticulously executed.

**Step 6: Effect Confirmation/**

(i) Process improvement should not end with implementation.  It is very important to measure the actual results and compare to predicted. If the actual results differ from the predicted ones, research needs to be conducted to figure out why, modify the process and repeat implementation and follow-up (i.e., repeat the A3 process) until the goal is met.

(ii) Since the A3 exercise bases on the PDCA cycle, this section of your report should show the effort you expended to confirm your findings. The proof that you have indeed solved the problem. For example, software engineers include samples that replicate the bugs and verify they are no longer present after a fix.

If the exercise has not taken place yet, i.e., when you’re presenting a plan to gain approval, you should outline what exercises you will conduct to check if the aim is successful.

(iii) These folks stopped at implementation.

**Step 7:**

(i) A critical step in the learning process of problem-solvers is to verify whether they truly understood the current condition well enough to improve it. Therefore, a follow-up plan becomes a critical step in process improvement to make sure the implementation plan was executed, the target condition realized, and the expected results achieved. 

(ii) The final section should include any other actions that you might want to consider. A principle worth adhering to here is the “Shitsuke - sustain” step of the 5S plan. Consider what you should do to ensure the benefits of this exercise are maintained. And could they possibly be translated to other areas of the company?

(iii) These folks stopped at implementation.
