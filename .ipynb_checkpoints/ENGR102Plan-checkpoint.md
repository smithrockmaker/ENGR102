### Current Plan for ENGR 102
### 12/8/24

### Disclaimer!!

Please note that this is my first time creating curriculum for this course. As a result, everything below might change based on a range of factors from technology to skills development. For this reason it would be best not to get too far ahead of what is written here. If you want to explore ahead in various ways that's fine as long as you take ownership of that decision and are willing to adapt if the curriculum changes.

### Instructional Model: 

To the extent possible I hope to focus on group exercises with limited passive presentation. This is always an aspiration since the enormous volumes of information tempt me to talk way too much. Be warned!!

**Class:** 

2 hours a week with the entire group (up to 48 students but probably less) SCI 190. General plan is to focus on student questions and engineering design systems on Mondays and CAD skills/assessment and 3D printing during class on Wednesday.

**CAD Learning**

I will suggest 30 min or so of YouTube tutorials  each week which will take you an hour or so to explore. The primary resource will be the two Youtube channels below.

- [Product Design Online](https://www.youtube.com/@ProductDesignOnline): A special thanks to Kevin Kennedy for generously making his **Learn Fusion 360 in 30 Days** available to everyone through his Product Design Online youtube channel. There are many videos out there but this series has been recommended by some that I trust in the maker/hacker community.

- [Lars Christensen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5bc9c3S12g&list=PL40d7srwyc_Ow4aaOGXlP2idPGwD7ruKg) Another generous soul who makes a large number of videos for learning about Fusion 360 available to the public. Also recommended by my same community.

**Lab: CAD**  
**Lab: 3d Print**

3 hours a week in SCI 250 with access to laptops and instrument room. My thought at this time is to structure activities so three groups have access to the 3D printers for 60 min (roughly) and then another 3 groups have access to the printers (we only have 3). This would suggest groups of up to 4 (24 students) if the lab section is full. When not working with printers focus will be CAD or design activities.

### Digital Resources: Github

There are a large number of digital resources to keep track of for this course. When in doubt look for the links you need in the DigitalResources document on the [main page of the github](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/tree/main).

### Week 1: Jan 6

**Class Topic(s):** 

**Day 1:** Understanding course goals. Getting software tools (Fusion 360 and Prusa Slicer) installed and verified on each student's machine. Discuss learning goals relative to software tools. See [Week1Content](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/blob/main/Classroom/Week1Content.md) in the Classroom folder on the github.

**Day 2:** Troubleshoot software installation issues (to some extent). Introduce Fusion 360 and Prusa Slicer. Exploration of 3D printers to become more comfortable. Print simple object provided by instructor.

**Outcomes:** 

* Describe the course plan and how it fits into program

* Download and install software needed to participate in the course

* Access and begin using learning tools for CAD

**CAD Learning**

Day 1 from Kevin. This is a quick start to understanding how to work in Fusion 360. Be sure and follow along and create your own version of the design. We will be using this elsewhere in the course soon. 13 min

Different approach but also gets you many skills in short order. Be aware that he is using an older version of Fusion 360 so the tools and menus look a little different. That is intentional on my part and good practice for you. 20 min

**CAD Deliverables**

Find a physical object with at least 3 distinct cross sections. Only one those cross sections may be a rectangle, circle, or square. In Fusion 360 create a separate sketch (in the same file) of each of the 3 cross sections. 

**Lab: 3D Print** 

Print test object and analyze outcomes

**Unresolved:** 

### Week 3: MLK Holiday, Jan 22

**Class Topic(s):** 

**Day 1:** Holiday today.

**Day 2:** 

**Outcomes:** 

**CAD Learning**

Even though we don't have class on Monday there is plenty of time to stay on track with developing your Fusion skills.

Day 3 from Kevin. Cool to learn about sweeping.

Finishing the Conduit Box: (part 3). Feels good to finish the box. Adding the screws is irritating. Don't get stuck on that part as it is not high value at this moment.
