### Current Plan for ENGR 102
### 12/8/24

### Instructional Model: 

To the extent possible I hope to focus on group exercises with limited passive presentation. This is always an aspiration since the enormous volumes of information tempt me to talk way too much. Be warned!!

**Class:** 

2 hours a week with the entire group (up to 48 students but probably less) SCI 190.

**CAD Learning**

I will suggest 30 min or so of YouTube tutorials which will take you an hour or so to explore each week.

- [Product Design Online](https://www.youtube.com/@ProductDesignOnline): A special thanks to Kevin Kennedy for generously making his **Learn Fusion 360 in 30 Days** available to everyone through his Product Design Online youtube channel. There are many videos out there but this series has been recommended by some that I trust in the maker/hacker community.

- [Lars Christensen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5bc9c3S12g&list=PL40d7srwyc_Ow4aaOGXlP2idPGwD7ruKg) Another generous soul who makes a large number of videos for learning about Fusion 360 available to the public. Also recommended by my same community.

**Lab: CAD**  
**Lab: 3d Print**

3 hours a week in SCI 250 with access to laptops and instrument room. My thought at this time is to structure activities so three groups have access to the 3D printers for 60 min (roughly) and then another 3 groups have access to the printers (we only have 3). This would suggest groups of up to 4 (24 students) if the lab section is full. When not working with printers focus will be CAD or design activities.

### Digital Resources: Github

There are a large number of digital resources to keep track of for this course. When in doubt look for the links you need in the DigitalResources document on the [main page of the github](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/ENGR102/tree/main).

### Week 1:

**Class Topic(s):** 

Understanding course goals. Getting software tools (Fusion 360 and Prusa Slicer) installed and verified on each student's machine. Discuss learning goals relative to software tools. See Week1Content in the Classroom folder on the github.

**CAD Learning**

Day 1 from Kevin. This is a quick start to understanding how to work in Fusion 360. Be sure and follow along and create your own version of the design. We will be using this elsewhere in the course soon. 13 min

Different approach but also gets you many skills in short order. Be aware that he is using an older version of Fusion 360 so the tools and menus look a little different. That is intentional on my part and good practice for you. 20 min

Course Description

Explores design strategies and design thinking to define multiple options to engineering problems that satisfy technical and social requirements. Practices professional engineering and communication skills that contribute to the success of teams. Applies appropriate hardware and software tools to implement one or more solutions to a design problem.
Course learning outcomes

1. Apply convergent and divergent thinking to a team design project.
2. Model best practices in collaborative problem solving in engineering.
3. Apply computational tools to solve an engineering problem.
4. Create a work plan for an engineering team design project.
5. Employ best practices in technical communication.
6. Diagnose errors and uncertainties in an engineering solution.
Content outline

    Design Thinking
    Design Strategies
    Collaborative Problem Solving
    Tools: Software
    Tools: Hardware
    Team Planning
    Solution Criteria and Evaluation
    Practice Engineering Application

The outcomes of this course will be met through a project based curriculum that aligns with content in ENGR 100. A primary focus of this course will be CAD/CAM skills and fabrication techniques that are central to modern engineering practice. This course is designed to have adaptable content to serve the needs of a range of different engineering programs. Hands on design and build skills will be embedded along with introductory applications of engineering and mathematical tools. Documentation of projects through technical writing as well as public presentations will form a natural part of the curriculum.
